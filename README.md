# About me
My name is Patrick Corrigan. I currently study biology and chemistry at UConn, and during the pandemic, I taught myself graduate level skills in programming and deep learning. I have made this GitHub to demonstrate my abilities in machine learning and deep learning.

I believe that deep learning is the future of the physical sciences, especially biology. Datasets in biology tend to be very large, and usually have non-linear trends. This makes it difficult for traditional data analysis to process biological data. How can a computer determine whether or not an image contains the specific kind of cell you are looking for? The answer is machine learning, and deep learning in particular. Machine learning allows computers to do data analysis tasks that previously only humans could do. The implications of this are clear. Data analysis in biology could be largely automated, which would dramatically increase the pace and scope of the research possible. This is why I spent thousands of hours teaching myself this subject from the ground up. I believe that deep learning is the future of the biological sciences, and physical sciences as a whole.
